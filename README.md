2. Change the directory to the "backend" by using `cd backend`.
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

- `py -m venv name`, replace 'name' with a name you like
- `name\Scripts\activate.bat`

4. Install the backend dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Open another console and go to the "frontend" directory.
6. Install the frontend dependencies by running `yarn install`.
7. Run the backend by using `py manage.py runserver` and then run the frontend by using `npm start`.

Note: make sure to activate the virtual environment to run the backend part of the project, i.e., the Django project.
